# Gemini API demo

## install api


```python
!pip install -qU google-generativeai
```

## Initialize the model


```python
import google.generativeai as genai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

#genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["API_KEY"])
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
```


```python
response = model.generate_content("tell a joke about AI")
print(response.text)
```

    Why did the AI get fired from the dating app?
    
    Because it kept trying to match people with themselves! ðŸ˜œ 
    


## list models


```python
for m in genai.list_models():
  if 'generateContent' in m.supported_generation_methods:
    print(m.name)
```

    ________________________________________________________________________________
    GenAI** stands for **Generative Artificial Intelligence**. 
    
    It refers to
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on **creating new content**,
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     such as:
    
    * **Text:** Writing stories, articles, poems, code, emails, and more.
    * **Images:** Generating realistic or artistic images
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     from text prompts.
    * **Audio:** Creating music, sound effects, and speech.
    * **Video:** Generating short videos or animations.
    * **
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    Code:** Writing code in various programming languages.
    
    **How GenAI works:**
    
    GenAI models are trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to learn patterns and relationships. They use this knowledge to generate new outputs that are similar to
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     the training data but also unique and creative.
    
    **Key techniques used in GenAI:**
    
    * **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These models involve two networks: a generator that creates content and a discriminator that evaluates
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     its quality.
    * **Transformers:** These are powerful language models that excel at understanding and generating text.
    * **Diffusion Models:** These models learn to gradually remove noise from data to create new content.
    
    **Examples of GenAI applications:**
    
    * **Chatbots:** Creating conversational AI that can engage in human-
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    like interactions.
    * **Content creation:** Generating articles, social media posts, and marketing materials.
    * **Art and design:** Creating unique paintings, sculptures, and architectural designs.
    * **Music composition:** Composing original music in various genres.
    * **Drug discovery:** Generating new drug candidates.
    
    **
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    Benefits of GenAI:**
    
    * **Creativity and innovation:** GenAI empowers individuals and businesses to create new and original content.
    * **Efficiency and productivity:** It automates content creation tasks, saving time and resources.
    * **Personalization:** GenAI can generate customized content based on individual preferences.
    
    **Challenges
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     of GenAI:**
    
    * **Ethical considerations:** Concerns about the potential misuse of GenAI, such as creating deepfakes or spreading misinformation.
    * **Bias and fairness:** GenAI models can inherit biases from the training data.
    * **Job displacement:** The automation capabilities of GenAI may lead to job displacement
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     in certain sectors.
    
    **Conclusion:**
    
    GenAI is a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize various industries. As GenAI continues to evolve, it will likely have a profound impact on how we create, interact with, and experience the world around us.

> This is a colorful abstract illustration reminiscent of mid-century modern design. It features various shapes, colors, and lines, creating a dynamic and eye-catching composition. The shapes are primarily organic and geometric, with a mix of circles, ovals, stars, and crescent moons. The colors used are bold and vibrant, including yellow, blue, red, and black. The background is a light beige, which helps the colors pop. The use of thin black lines and the overall visual style evoke a sense of playful experimentation and artistic freedom, characteristic of mid-century modern design.

> ## A Splash of Color: Exploring the World of Abstract Art 
> 
> This vibrant artwork, reminiscent of the iconic style of **Joan MirÃ³**, features a playful and dynamic composition. Set against a warm, off-white background, the piece bursts with color, employing bold shapes, simple lines, and playful details. 
> 
> The artwork evokes a sense of movement and energy, with swirling lines, geometric forms, and starbursts scattered across the canvas. The use of primary colors - blue, yellow, and red - creates a sense of vibrancy and immediacy, while the black and white elements add depth and contrast. 
> 
> The artist's **Abstract Expressionist** style draws inspiration from the natural world, incorporating organic forms and free-flowing lines. However, the overall effect is a celebration of pure abstraction, encouraging the viewer to engage with the piece on a personal level and interpret its meaning. 
> 
> This artwork is a wonderful example of how abstract art can be both visually captivating and intellectually stimulating. It invites us to step back, appreciate the beauty of pure form and color, and explore the infinite possibilities of artistic expression.

## embeddings
With Gemini, you can represent text (words, sentences, and blocks of text) in a vectorized form, making it easier to compare and contrast embeddings.


```python
result = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/embedding-001",
    content="What is genAI?",
    task_type="retrieval_document",
    title="Embedding of single string")

# 1 input > 1 vector output
print(str(result['embedding'])[:50], '... TRIMMED]')
```

    [-0.00067465234, -0.020503446, 0.018540338, 0.0025 ... TRIMMED]



```python
result = genai.embed_content(

## Multi-turn conversations

genai.ChatSession is just a wrapper around GenerativeModel.generate_content.


```python
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

messages = [
    {'role':'user',
     'parts': ["Briefly explain how a smart phone works to a child."]}
]
response = model.generate_content(messages)

to_markdown(response.text)
```




> Imagine your phone is like a tiny, super smart computer that fits in your pocket! 
> 
> It has a screen that shows you pictures, videos, and words, just like a TV. You can use your fingers to tap and swipe on the screen to tell the phone what you want to do. 
> 
> Inside the phone is a special chip called a "brain" that helps it understand what you want. It uses this "brain" to connect to the internet, which is like a giant library with lots of information.  
> 
> You can use your phone to:
> 
> * **Make calls and send messages:** Talk to your friends and family like a walkie-talkie!
> * **Play games and watch videos:** Have fun and learn new things!
> * **Take pictures and videos:** Capture memories and share them with others!
> * **Read books and listen to music:** Relax and learn!
> 
> Your phone is a powerful tool that helps you connect with the world, have fun, and learn new things!

> Think of your smartphone as a mini-computer that fits in your pocket.  It's a complex machine that works together in a fascinating way:
> 
> **Hardware:**
> 
> * **Processor:** This is the brain of the phone, a tiny chip that executes instructions, runs programs, and processes data. The faster the processor, the quicker your phone can handle demanding tasks like gaming or editing videos.
> * **Memory:**  Like your computer's RAM, this temporary storage holds data that the processor needs to access quickly. More RAM means your phone can run more apps at the same time without slowing down.
> * **Storage:** This is where your photos, apps, and other data are stored permanently. You can choose between internal storage built into the phone or expandable storage using a microSD card.
> * **Display:** This is the screen you see, using pixels to display images, text, and videos. Different phones have different screen sizes and resolutions, affecting their quality and sharpness.
> * **Battery:**  This powers the entire system, allowing you to use your phone without needing to be plugged in. Battery life is influenced by many factors like screen brightness, app usage, and processor power.
> 
> **Software:**
> 
> * **Operating System (OS):** This is the software that controls the phone's hardware and provides a user interface. The most popular smartphone operating systems are Android and iOS.
> * **Apps:**  These are programs that provide specific functionality, like social media, games, productivity tools, and communication. They run on the OS and interact with the hardware.
> 
> **Connectivity:**
> 
> * **Cellular Network:** This allows you to make calls, send texts, and access the internet. It uses radio waves to communicate with cell towers, creating a wireless connection.
> * **Wi-Fi:** This provides a faster and more reliable internet connection when you are within range of a Wi-Fi network.
> * **Bluetooth:** This allows wireless communication with other devices like headphones, speakers, and cars.
> 
> **How It Works:**
> 
> 1. **User Interaction:**  You interact with the phone through the touchscreen, inputting commands by tapping, swiping, and typing.
> 2. **Software Processes:** The OS interprets your commands, accessing and executing the relevant app.
> 3. **Hardware Operations:** The processor, RAM, and storage work together to handle the app's instructions, retrieving data and processing it.
> 4. **Data Transmission:** If the app needs to communicate with the internet, it utilizes the cellular network or Wi-Fi to send and receive data.
> 5. **Output:** The display, speakers, and other hardware components present the results of the app's operation.
> 
> Your smartphone is a marvel of modern technology, seamlessly integrating hardware and software to provide a powerful tool for communication, entertainment, and information access.
