# Gemini API demo

## Install api


```python
!pip install -qU google-generativeai
```

## Initialize the model


```python
import google.generativeai as genai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
```


```python
response = model.generate_content("tell a joke about AI")
print(response.text)
```

    Why did the AI get fired from the library?
    
    Because it kept telling people to "Google it!" ðŸ˜‚ 
    


## List models


```python
for m in genai.list_models():
  if 'generateContent' in m.supported_generation_methods:
    print(m.name)
```

    models/gemini-1.0-pro-latest
    models/gemini-1.0-pro
    models/gemini-pro
    models/gemini-1.0-pro-001
    models/gemini-1.0-pro-vision-latest

    ________________________________________________________________________________
    GenAI (Generative AI)** refers to a category of artificial intelligence (AI
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    ) that focuses on creating new content, such as:
    
    * **Text:**
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     Writing articles, stories, poems, code, emails, etc.
    * **Images:** Generating realistic or stylized images from text descriptions.
    * **Audio:**
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     Creating music, sound effects, voiceovers, etc.
    * **Video:** Producing short videos or animations.
    * **3D Models:** Generating 3
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    D objects and environments.
    
    **How GenAI Works:**
    
    GenAI systems are trained on massive datasets of existing content. They learn patterns and relationships within the data, enabling them to generate new content that resembles the training data. 
    
    
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    **Key Techniques in GenAI:**
    
    * **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Two neural networks compete against each other, one generating content and the other evaluating its realism.
    * **Variational Autoencoders (
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    VAEs):** Encode input data into a compressed representation and then decode it to generate new content.
    * **Transformers:** Powerful deep learning models that excel at language processing, enabling them to create coherent and contextually relevant text.
    * **Diffusion Models:** Start with random noise and gradually refine it to generate realistic outputs
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    .
    
    **Examples of GenAI Applications:**
    
    * **Content Creation:** Writing marketing copy, generating social media posts, creating artistic images.
    * **Product Design:** Designing new products, prototypes, and 3D models.
    * **Education:** Generating personalized learning materials, creating interactive simulations.
    * **Healthcare
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    :** Analyzing medical images, generating personalized treatment plans.
    * **Entertainment:** Creating music, video games, and interactive stories.
    
    **Benefits of GenAI:**
    
    * **Creativity and Innovation:** GenAI can unlock new creative possibilities and generate unique content.
    * **Efficiency and Productivity:** Automation of content creation tasks saves
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     time and resources.
    * **Personalization:** GenAI can create customized experiences tailored to individual preferences.
    * **New Business Opportunities:** Enables new applications and business models.
    
    **Challenges of GenAI:**
    
    * **Bias and Ethical Concerns:** GenAI systems can perpetuate biases present in the training data.
    *
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     **Fake Content and Misinformation:** GenAI can be used to create convincing fake content, raising concerns about misinformation.
    * **Copyright and Intellectual Property:** Ownership and rights of AI-generated content can be complex.
    
    **Conclusion:**
    
    GenAI is a rapidly evolving field with significant potential to transform various industries. While
    ________________________________________________________________________________
     challenges exist, GenAI offers exciting opportunities for creativity, innovation, and efficiency.

> This is a very abstract piece of art. It uses various shapes and colors, including circles, teardrop shapes, and stars. It's hard to know what it's supposed to be.  The colors are bright and bold. The artist has used a lot of black and white, which makes the colors stand out more.  It could be interpreted in many different ways, which is part of what makes it so interesting.

> ##  A Splash of Color: Exploring the Art of Joan MirÃ³
> 
> This vibrant artwork, bursting with color and geometric shapes, is a prime example of Joan MirÃ³'s signature style. MirÃ³, a renowned Spanish painter and sculptor, was a key figure in the Surrealist movement, known for his whimsical and dreamlike imagery.
> 
> The piece before us features a playful combination of organic and geometric shapes. We see a mix of circles, ovals, and stars, each rendered in bold primary colors â€“ blues, reds, yellows, and blacks â€“ against a soft cream background. 
> 
> MirÃ³â€™s work often evokes a sense of childlike wonder and a fascination with the subconscious. The playful arrangement of shapes and the bold use of color create a sense of movement and energy, inviting the viewer to engage with the artwork on a purely visual level.
> 
> This piece is not just a beautiful arrangement of colors; it's a gateway to MirÃ³'s world, a world filled with imagination, creativity, and the joy of pure visual expression.

## Multi-turn conversations

genai.ChatSession is just a wrapper around GenerativeModel.generate_content.


```python
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

messages = [
    {'role':'user',
     'parts': ["Briefly explain how a smart phone works to a child."]}
]
response = model.generate_content(messages)

to_markdown(response.text)
```




> Imagine your smartphone is like a tiny, magical computer that fits in your hand! It's like having a whole world of information and fun in your pocket.
> 
> Here's how it works:
> 
> * **Brain:** Inside your phone is a powerful brain called a processor. It's like the super smart part of your phone that lets it do all the cool things.
> * **Eyes:** The screen is like your phone's eyes. It shows you pictures, videos, and words so you can see what's happening.
> * **Ears:** The speaker lets you hear music, games, and your friends' voices when you talk on the phone.
> * **Mouth:** The microphone lets your phone hear you when you talk to it or record your voice.
> * **Magic Touch:** You can tap, swipe, and pinch the screen to tell your phone what you want to do. It's like magic!
> 
> With all these parts working together, your phone can:
> 
> * **Play Games:** You can race cars, build things, and solve puzzles on your phone!
> * **Watch Videos:** You can see funny cartoons, learn about animals, and watch your favorite shows.
> * **Talk to Friends:** You can call or video chat with your friends and family, even if they're far away.
> * **Learn New Things:** You can read books, find out about different topics, and even learn a new language!
> 
> Isn't it amazing how much your phone can do? It's like a pocket-sized adventure!

> Your smartphone is essentially a mini-computer packed with advanced technology. It's a complex system that uses many interconnected components to work its magic:
> 
> **1. Hardware:**
> 
> * **Processor (CPU):** This is the brain of your phone, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It's like the central processing unit of a computer.
> * **Memory (RAM):** This is where your phone temporarily stores data that it's currently using. Imagine it as your phone's short-term memory.
> * **Storage:** This is where your phone keeps all your apps, photos, videos, and other data.  It's like your phone's long-term memory. 
> * **Battery:** This powers your phone and is like its fuel source.
> * **Sensors:** Your phone has many sensors that detect movement, light, and even your touch. These help it interact with the world around it.
> * **Display:** The screen is a digital display that shows you information and lets you interact with your phone.
> 
> **2. Software:**
> 
> * **Operating System (OS):**  The OS is the software that manages all the hardware and allows you to use your phone. Android and iOS are the two most popular smartphone operating systems.
> * **Applications (Apps):** These are software programs that let you do specific tasks on your phone, like browsing the internet, playing games, or taking photos.
> * **Network Connectivity:** Your phone uses cellular networks (like 4G or 5G) or Wi-Fi to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices.
> 
> **3. How it Works:**
> 
> * **Input:** You interact with your phone through touch, voice commands, and sensors.
> * **Processing:** The processor analyzes your input and executes instructions based on your commands.
> * **Output:** The results are displayed on your screen, played through speakers, or sent through network connections.
> 
> **Essentially, your smartphone is a sophisticated device that allows you to access information, communicate, and entertain yourself. It's a mini-computer that can fit in your pocket, connecting you to the world in countless ways.**
