      "# Example usage:\n",
      "dos2unix('input.txt', 'output.txt')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Function Definition:**\n",
      "   - The code defines a function `dos2unix` that takes two arguments: `input_file` (path to the DOS formatted file) and `output_file` (path to the output Unix formatted file).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **File Handling:**\n",
      "   - It opens the input file in binary read mode (`'rb'`) and the output file in binary write mode (`'wb'`). This ensures that the file contents are read and written as raw bytes, preserving the line endings.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Line-by-Line Conversion:**\n",
      "   - The code iterates through each line in the input file using a `for` loop.\n",
      "   - For each line, it replaces the DOS line ending (`\\r\\n`) with the Unix line ending (`\\n`) using the `replace` method.\n",
      "   - The modified line is then written to the output file.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Example Usage:**\n",
      "   - The code provides an example of how to use the `dos2unix` function. It calls the function with the input file path (`'input.txt'`) and the output file path (`'output.txt'`).\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Use:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Save the code:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `dos2unix.py`).\n",
      "2. **Run the code:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Run the following command:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   python dos2unix.py\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Replace `input.txt` and `output.txt` with the actual file paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- This code assumes that the input file is in DOS format (using `\\r\\n` as line endings).\n",
      "- The output file will be created in Unix format (using `\\n` as line endings).\n",
      "- You can modify the code to handle other file formats or to perform additional conversions as needed.\n",
