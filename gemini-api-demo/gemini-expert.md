# Build an expert using Gemini Flash 1.5 

Here is demo how to create a general tool that can be customized to handle various expert systems.


```python
import google.generativeai as genai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

def setup_api_key():
    """Set up the API key for the model."""
    load_dotenv()
    genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])

def create_expert_model(system_instruction: str) -> genai.GenerativeModel:
    """Create and return a Generative AI model configured with the provided system instruction."""
    return genai.GenerativeModel(
        model_name='gemini-1.5-flash-latest',
        generation_config={"temperature": 0},
        system_instruction=system_instruction
    )

def get_expert_answer(model: genai.GenerativeModel, user_input: str) -> str:
    """
    Uses the Generative AI model to generate an answer based on the user input.
    
    Args:
        model (genai.GenerativeModel): The Generative AI model configured with the system instruction.
        user_input (str): The input from the user that the expert model will respond to.
    
    Returns:
        str: The expert's answer to the user input, in plain text format.
    """
    response = model.generate_content(user_input).text
    return response

def main():
    setup_api_key()
    
    # Define the system instruction for the expert model
    system_instruction = """
    You are an expert in a specific field. Your task is to provide precise, detailed, and well-informed answers based on the user input.
    """
    
    # Create the expert model with the system instruction
    model = create_expert_model(system_instruction)
    
    # Accept user input
    user_input = input("Enter your query for the expert: ")
    
    # Get the expert's answer
    expert_answer = get_expert_answer(model, user_input)
    
    # Print the expert's answer
    print("Expert's Answer:")
    print(expert_answer)

    Enter your query for the expert:  write a code to convert text format from DOS to Linux


    Expert's Answer:
    ```python
    def dos2unix(input_file, output_file):
      """Converts a file from DOS to Unix format.
    
      Args:
        input_file: The path to the input file.
        output_file: The path to the output file.
      """
    
      with open(input_file, 'rb') as infile, open(output_file, 'wb') as outfile:
        for line in infile:
          # Replace carriage return and line feed with just line feed
          line = line.replace(b'\r\n', b'\n')
          outfile.write(line)
    
    # Example usage:
    dos2unix('input.txt', 'output.txt')
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    1. **Function Definition:**
       - The code defines a function `dos2unix` that takes two arguments: `input_file` (path to the DOS formatted file) and `output_file` (path to the output Unix formatted file).
    
    2. **File Handling:**
       - It opens the input file in binary read mode (`'rb'`) and the output file in binary write mode (`'wb'`). This ensures that the file contents are read and written as raw bytes, preserving the line endings.
    
    3. **Line-by-Line Conversion:**
       - The code iterates through each line in the input file using a `for` loop.
       - For each line, it replaces the DOS line ending (`\r\n`) with the Unix line ending (`\n`) using the `replace` method.
       - The modified line is then written to the output file.
    
    4. **Example Usage:**
       - The code provides an example of how to use the `dos2unix` function. It calls the function with the input file path (`'input.txt'`) and the output file path (`'output.txt'`).
    
    **How to Use:**
    
    1. **Save the code:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `dos2unix.py`).
    2. **Run the code:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Run the following command:
       ```bash
       python dos2unix.py
       ```
       Replace `input.txt` and `output.txt` with the actual file paths.
    
    **Note:**
    
    - This code assumes that the input file is in DOS format (using `\r\n` as line endings).
    - The output file will be created in Unix format (using `\n` as line endings).
    - You can modify the code to handle other file formats or to perform additional conversions as needed.
    


## Explanation:
1. **Setup Function:** `setup_genai()` configures the Generative AI API using the environment variables.
2. **Expert Model Creation:** `create_expert_model(system_instruction)` creates a Generative AI model with the given system instruction.
3. **Get Expert Answer:** `get_expert_answer(model, user_input)` uses the model to generate a response based on user input.
4. **Main Function:** 
   - Sets up the environment.
   - Defines a general system instruction for the expert model.
   - Creates the model.
   - Accepts user input.
   - Retrieves and prints the expert's answer.

This tool is flexible and can be adapted for various expert systems by changing the `system_instruction` and model parameters as needed.
